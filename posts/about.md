How to Join Us
--------------

Most of the events run by GeekSoc are free and open to everybody, regardless of whether you are a student at King's College London, or whether you are a member of GeekSoc. Please come along!

Though it's not needed to attend any of our events, we encourage you to become a member of GeekSoc. If you are a student at KCL this involves paying Â£6.00 to KCLSU, which you can do [here][kclsu-page]. People who are not KCL students cannot become members in the same way. The benefits of becoming a member are:

- You pay less to get into the few events we charge for.
- You can stand and vote in the committee elections at the end of the year.
- The society is given some of the money you pay to KCLSU, which funds our activities.
- The society needs at least 25 people to sign up as members each year.
