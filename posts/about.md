How to Join Us
--------------

All of the events run by GeekSoc are open to everybody, and most of them are free. This is regardless of whether you are a student at King's College London, or whether you are a member of GeekSoc. Please come along!

Though it's not needed to attend any of our events, we encourage you to become a member of GeekSoc. The benefits of becoming a member are:

- You pay less to get into the few events we charge for.
- You can stand and vote in the committee elections at the end of the year.
- The society is given some of the money you pay to KCLSU, which funds our activities.
- The society can continue existing if at least 25 people to sign up as members each year.

If you are a KCL student membership costs £6.00 which you can pay through the KCL Student Union at this [web page][membership-page] or in person at [KCLSU student centres][student-centres].

If you are not a KCL student you will first have to get associate membership of KCL Student Union for £15.00 with [this form][associate-form], then pay £6.00 through this [web page][membership-page] or in person at [KCLSU student centres][student-centres].
