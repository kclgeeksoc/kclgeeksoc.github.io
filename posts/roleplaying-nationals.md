Student National Roleplaying and Wargaming Championship 2014
============================================================

What is it?
-----------

The Student Nationals is a nation-wide get together of university student roleplayers, wargamers and... whatever the collective noun for people who play card games is. We spent a weekend meeting new people then playing games with them. The event is being held on 11th-13th April 2014 at Leicester University. For more information see the [Student Nationals information pack][information-pack].

How do I sign up?
-----------------

You can [sign up with this form][sign-up] before 8th December 2013. You should also pay the £20 sign up fee before the 11th December.

When you sign up you'll have to choose three categories of game you'd like to play. You'll spend the whole weekend playing game in one of those categories - your first choice if possible. These are categories such as "Science Fiction", "Dungeons and Dragons 4th" or "Indie", but check out the complete list of categories in the [information pack][information-pack] before choosing.

How much will it cost?
----------------------

The Student Nationals will cost £68-83 for the whole weekend. This pays for:

- £20 entry fee.
- £33 [accommodation][accommodation] in the University of Leicester halls (breakfast included).
- £15 to £30 travel by train or coach.

The £20 sign-up fee must reach us by the 11th of December because the organisers need to receive our booking and fees by the 15th. The accommodation and travel costs will be finalised and paid at a later date. Paid up members of Geeksoc will receive a discount on this, though the size of the discount has not been decided upon.

You can pay in the following ways:

- Cash. Give the money to a committee member and they'll give you a receipt.
- Cheque. Hand this to a committee member. Make it payable to "KCLSU", with "Geek Society, 162" written on the back.
- Bank transfer. To account: 22521526, sort code: 56-00-13 with a reference including "Geek Society, 162".

What else do I need to know?
----------------------------

Please note that just like Geeksoc, the Student Nationals wants everybody who attends to enjoy themselves, and as such has a code of conduct. This is available on page 9 of the [information pack][information-pack]. Anybody violating this code of conduct will not be permitted to attend.

Also note that entry fees are non-refundable after the 11th of December. Monies paid towards transport and accommodation are non-refundable upon receipt. Non-payment of fees towards transport and accommodation will result in you not being permitted to attend.
